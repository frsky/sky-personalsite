I guess the best way to explain it is: I love working with technology and how it relates to business and culture. I've been an engineer, inventor, investor, entrepreneur -- and yes a disruptor (apologies for the buzzword there).</p><p class="boxprose">As for experience, I've worked for several Fortune 500 companies, been part of a number of start-ups, developed some products, invented a few things, won a few awards, got a bunch of press, and owned alot of Legos (although my son now claims them). I started software company right of of college, and I've been building businesses ever since. I tried to make this site fun and engaging, rather than just dropping the resume into a web page.</p><p class="boxprose">But anyway -- close this box and go play with the stuff on the screen. Oh, and it works great on an iPad...</p><p class="boxprose" style="color:#CCCCCC;">E-Mail me: frank at sikernitsky dot com</p><p class="prose lighterprose">
