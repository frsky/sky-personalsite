<p class="boxprose"><strong>Long Story Short...</strong></p>
<p class="boxprose">
So, what does Frank Sikernitsky do? I guess the best way to explain it is: I love working with technology and how it relates to business and culture. I've been an engineer, inventor, investor, entrepreneur -- and yes a disruptor (apologies for the buzzword there).   </p>

<p class="boxprose">As for experience, I've worked for several Fortune 500 companies, been part of a number of start-ups, developed some products, toyed with a few inventions, won a few awards, and owned alot of Legos. I ended up starting a software company right of of college, and I've been building businesses ever since. I tried to make this site fun and engaging, rather than just dropping the resume into a web page.</p>

<!---p class="boxprose">While I've been around since 'New Media' days, change is the constant. New Media got old, and now we're into Mobility, Social, Cloud, and a bunch of things that are honestly way more interesting than spinning logos. </P--->
	
<!---p class="boxprose">I believe in being hands-on (I created this site, for example), but I'm also fascinated by how larger trends in the market drive new technologies and opportunities. In an industry where things get old quick, it's easy to get stuck in yesterday's 'new hotness' -- and I try to avoid that as often as possible. Somebody who worked for me probably put it best when she said: "you made it okay to think again". Maybe I do too much of that. </p--->

<p class="boxprose">But anyway -- close this box and go play with the stuff on the screen. Oh, and it works great on an iPad...</p>
